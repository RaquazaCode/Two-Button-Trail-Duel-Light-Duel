# Deep Research + Build Spec: “Lightcycle Duel” (Tron-Style Trail Kill Game)

## Competitor Teardown Matrix

Below is a comparative matrix of **Tron-style “dueling bikes” games** (and similar trail-based snake games) across platforms. Each row is one title or family of titles, with key design attributes in columns. This highlights how each game handles controls, movement, arena design, trails, collisions, skill ceiling, randomness, multiplayer tech, spectator experience, retention hooks, and unique differentiators.

For example, Armagetron’s manual confirms the 90° turn and wall-grinding boost mechanic[7](https://wiki.armagetronad.org/index.php/The_Basics#:~:text=Armagetron%20Advanced%20works%20on%20the,down%20to%20the%20base%20speed); Achtung’s Wikipedia notes the occasional random gaps in trails[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtung,_die_Kurve!#:~:text=Other%20players%20may%20try%20to,4); GLTron’s documentation describes its turbo and wall-accel modes[9](https://fossgames.com/gltron-light-cycle-3d-tron-game/#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20the%20game,the%20player%E2%80%99s%20light%20cycle%E2%80%99s%20speed); LightBike 2’s reviews highlight its multi-level arenas and jumps[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightBike#:~:text=our%20breath,5%20%5D%5B%2056); and powerline.io’s description shows its slither-like growth and energy mechanics[18](https://slitheriogame.io/powerlineio#:~:text=You%20can%20eliminate%20other%20enemies,Get%20close).

### “What We Steal” – Notable Mechanics to Borrow

Below we list key mechanics or design ideas from each competitor (or group of similar games) that are **worth considering for our new Lightcycle Duel game**. These are distilled as **mechanics (not art styles)** that proved successful or engaging:

* **Blockade/Surround (origins):** *Simplicity and symmetry.* All players start in a symmetric empty arena with identical capabilities (no unfair advantages) – ensures outcomes are purely skill-based.

* **Tron Arcade (1982):** *Instant clarity of 90° turns.* Right-angle turning gives the game a distinct, easy-to-read geometry and tactical predictability that enhances spectator understanding.

* **Achtung, die Kurve! and Curve Fever (classic curve games):**

* **Smooth steering & gradual turns** – increases the skill ceiling by allowing subtle feints and swooping maneuvers instead of only rigid angles.

* **Controlled gaps in trails** – the idea of occasional gaps (in Achtung it was random[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtung,_die_Kurve!#:~:text=Other%20players%20may%20try%20to,4)) can be adapted into a **skill-triggered gap** to escape traps, adding depth without pure RNG.

* **Local multiplayer instant fun** – low barrier to play with friends on one screen; we can emulate this in a “party mode” for quick matches.

* **Armagetron Advanced:**

* **Wall-grind speed boosts** – rewarding risk (riding extremely close to a wall) with higher speed[7](https://wiki.armagetronad.org/index.php/The_Basics#:~:text=Armagetron%20Advanced%20works%20on%20the,down%20to%20the%20base%20speed). This creates a high-skill maneuver for advanced players and exciting “close shave” moments.

* **”Boxing” tactics and sealing** – the concept of enclosing opponents with your trail is core Tron; Armagetron showed the meta of speed + precision to perfectly “seal” someone in[8](https://wiki.armagetronad.org/index.php/The_Basics#:~:text=Image%20%20%2053A%20common,speed%20kill). We should ensure our game supports these tactics with precise collision and just the right trail length/persistence.

* **Server authoritative with lag compensation (rubber)** – Armagetron’s approach to netcode (server truth but with a “rubber” buffer for lag) keeps online play fair. We can emulate a similar lag compensation so that close calls are decided consistently, not by network hiccups.

* **GLTron:**

* **Turbo boost button** – an optional limited-use speed burst[9](https://fossgames.com/gltron-light-cycle-3d-tron-game/#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20the%20game,the%20player%E2%80%99s%20light%20cycle%E2%80%99s%20speed). This can add an extra layer of mind-games (save your boost to surprise cut-off an opponent, or escape one). We’d include this carefully (e.g. one boost per round or a cooldown) so it’s tactical, not spammable.

* **Multiple arena sizes/options** – GLTron allowed tiny arenas for intense 1v1 and bigger for group fights[10](https://fossgames.com/gltron-light-cycle-3d-tron-game/#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20arena%20sizes,to%20%E2%80%9Cvast%E2%80%9D). We can offer a few arena sizes or configurations (perhaps even dynamic shrinking) to keep matches fresh and accommodate different player counts.

* **Curve Fever Pro:**

* **Ability loadouts (powers)** – though we prefer low RNG, Curve Fever’s success with powers (e.g. shoot a gap, place a mine, shield yourself) shows an *opt-in* power system can prolong interest. We might include a **secondary game mode with power-ups** or a custom lobby option for casual fun, while keeping default mode pure.

* **Short round, quick restart loop** – Curve Fever rounds last ~1–2 minutes with instant rematch. This loop is addicting for streamers and casual players[5](https://prokalteng.jawapos.com/prostyle/teknologi/18/07/2025/game-io-terbaik-di-browser-bisa-main-gratis-tanpa-download-loh/#:~:text=Game%20IO%20Terbaik%20di%20Browser%3A,minute). We should ensure very short downtime between rounds in our design.

* **LightBike 2:**

* **Verticality (multi-level arenas)**[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightBike#:~:text=our%20breath,5%20%5D%5B%2056) – the introduction of ramps and multiple tiers where you can jump down or up was novel. For our game, a fully 3D multi-level arena might be complex, but we could incorporate a simpler version: e.g. a **temporary jump ability** that lets you hop over a trail (functionally similar to LB2’s ramps, but easier to implement as a power).

* **Jump/hover mechanic** – related to above, giving players a skillful way to **vault over a trail** (with strict cooldown) could be our version of the gap mechanic (skill-based, not random).

* **powerline.io:**

* **Proximity charge = speed boost** – encourage players to engage instead of camp. We can borrow this by giving a slight speed increase when two bikes are near each other head-to-head[20](https://light-bikes-io.soft112.com/#:~:text=Whether%20you%E2%80%99re%20bold%20or%20careful%2C,another%20opponents%20trail%2C%20your%20dead). This creates dramatic high-speed duels and rewards daredevil play.

* **Massive multiplayer scalability** – though our focus is likely on smaller lobbies, the tech idea of handling many players (perhaps in a chaotic FFA mode) could be interesting for a “royale” mode. Powerline.io shows that a lightweight client and simple physics can handle large player counts in a browser.

* **Slither.io (and similar snake games):**

* **Body length growth** – In our core mode we probably keep permanent walls (no growth). But we could consider a secondary mode where bikes have a finite trail length that grows with kills (like an arena snake), which introduces a territorial control element. This could be an alternate scoring mode (e.g. longest trail wins if time runs out).

* **Consumable pickups** – Slither uses pellets from dead snakes to create a comeback mechanic for smaller players. If we introduce any point or energy system, using the remains of defeated players as a resource could be a fair, self-balancing reward mechanism (the leader naturally leaves more “loot” when taken down).

* **General takeaways from others:**

* **Cosmetic rewards** (skins, bike light colors, trail patterns): Many successful games keep players coming back by unlocking purely visual flair. We should plan a progression system (e.g. earn “bytes” to unlock new neon trail colors or bike models) to boost retention without affecting gameplay.

* **Spectator-friendly design:** Ensure the camera can switch to an overhead full-grid view (like classic Tron and Achtung) for streaming, and use bright distinct colors for each player’s trail for clarity. Possibly include a replay/highlight of the final kill in slow-mo, which some modern titles do to celebrate the win.

* **Accessibility:** Nearly all these games have very simple controls (often just two buttons). We must retain that easy-to-learn aspect – anyone can press left/right and play – while providing depth through physics and strategy rather than complex inputs.

With these ideas in mind, we can craft a “best-of” design that combines the **clarity and fairness** of classic Tron with the **skill-expressive mechanics** (like wall-grinding, boosting, or jumping) that modern players enjoy, all while avoiding random unfair elements.

## “Best-of” Design Blueprint – *Lightcycle Duel*

**Elevator Pitch:** *A high-octane multiplayer lightcycle arena where players outmaneuver opponents with lethal neon trails and split-second tactics –* *classic Tron* *rules at heart, enhanced with modern twists for skillful escapes and highlight-reel moments.*

**Core Loop:** Fast rounds of **30–60 seconds** where 2–6 players duel in a neon grid arena. All bikes start simultaneously. They accelerate and weave trails until only one survivor remains (last man standing). The round winner scores a point (or in FFA, points for placements); then **instant rematch** – bikes respawn and the next round begins in seconds. The short round length and quick reset ensure a “just one more round” addiction cycle.

**Win Condition:** Last surviving player wins the round. In a casual lobby, you can play endless rounds for fun or up to a score limit. In a ranked match, use a **best-of-N rounds** format or point accumulation (e.g. first to 5 round wins takes the match). If a round reaches a stalemate condition (e.g. two players refuse to engage), a **sudden-death mechanic** like arena shrink will force a conclusion.

**No Random Powerups by Default:** The default mode has *no item drops or random buffs*. Every outcome is decided by player skill, positioning, and decisions. (We can offer an optional “arcade mode” with powerups for custom games, but not in ranked play.)

**Symmetrical Map Design:** The arena is designed with symmetry – all spawn positions are fair and equidistant. No spawn will confer a positional advantage. The initial orientation of bikes is set so that players are not facing each other immediately (to prevent instant collisions before players can react).

### Key Mechanics & Rules

**A) Trail Model:** Each bike leaves a solid neon **jetwall trail** of a set thickness (e.g. half the bike’s width) that persists **permanently for the duration of the round** (no fading) – essentially forming new “walls” in the arena[1](https://nobitgames.itch.io/tron-light-cycles-duel-2#:~:text=On%20the%20Grid%20designed%20for,along%20with%20their%20light%20cycle). Hitting any trail (including your own) is deadly. Trails are drawn with a high-resolution line so that even smooth turns produce a continuous curve or series of tight segments (no gaps unless intentionally created). By default, a bike **cannot cross its own trail** – your light trail is just as lethal to you as an enemy’s. This enforces territorial gameplay (you can trap yourself if not careful). All trails vanish at round end (resetting for the next round). **Trail thickness and collision**: The trails are slightly thinner than the bikes, ensuring that if two bikes ride side by side, their bodies might be adjacent without instant death, but the trails still block passage – this gives a tiny room for skilled players to ride parallel (“grinding”) without collision.

**Can trails overlap?** No – a trail is a wall. Two different trails cannot occupy the same space; if a bike tries to drive into any existing trail, it crashes. Bikes can **ride very close alongside** a trail without crashing (down to a few pixels gap) – this is by design to allow “grinding” skill maneuvers. **Trail crossing**: Since no crossing is allowed, the arena increasingly fills up with walls, making survival tougher over time – which naturally pressures the late-game without random factors.

**B) Turning & Movement:** We opt for **grid-style 90° turns** for the primary mode, to capture the classic Tron feel and maximize clarity. Bikes move in straight lines until the player inputs a turn. A tap left or right instantly yaws the bike 90 degrees left/right relative to its current direction. There is **no steering in between grid directions** (no gradual analog turns in default mode), simplifying controls and visuals. This yields sharp corners and recognizable strategies (like carving rectangles to trap foes).

* **Turning limits:** To prevent unnatural twitch spam, we enforce that the bike must travel at least a short distance (a few bike lengths) after a turn before another turn input registers (i.e. you cannot flip 180° on the same spot – that would crash you into your own trail anyway). This feel is similar to the original Tron arcade where you commit to a direction once turned. No cooldown on turns beyond that minimal distance – skilled players can still execute rapid zig-zags, but with physical space consequences.

* **Movement speed:** Bikes have a base constant speed (ensuring everyone is always moving – no camping in place, as brakes are disabled by default). However, we incorporate **speed dynamics inspired by Armagetron**: if you ride *very close alongside an existing trail* (either an opponent’s or your own), your bike will receive a slight **speed boost** proportional to how long and how tightly you “grind” that wall[7](https://wiki.armagetronad.org/index.php/The_Basics#:~:text=Armagetron%20Advanced%20works%20on%20the,down%20to%20the%20base%20speed). This means daring players who skim trails gain an advantage in positioning (at the risk of an accident). The boost will be capped to prevent ridiculous speeds – just enough to outpace someone not wall-grinding. Conversely, making a turn will cause a slight momentary **speed drop** (losing maybe 10% of speed for 1 second) to discourage endless zig-zagging to bleed speed. This models the idea that turning costs momentum (and matches Armagetron’s behavior where rapid successive turns slow you down[7](https://wiki.armagetronad.org/index.php/The_Basics#:~:text=Armagetron%20Advanced%20works%20on%20the,down%20to%20the%20base%20speed)). There is **no dedicated brake** in default mode; you manage speed by choosing when to grind (speed up) or zig-zag (slow down). This dynamic speed system rewards skillful control and yields more dramatic chases and escapes.

* **Optional analog mode:** For accessibility, we can provide an alternative control scheme/server setting where turning is analog (like Achtung). In that mode, bikes have a max turning rate instead of fixed 90° turns. This would be an unranked or separate mode for those who enjoy continuous curves. The core competitive mode remains 90° turns for fairness and consistency.

**C) “Gap” Skill Mechanic:** To allow skilled escape maneuvers and avoid purely deterministic traps, we introduce a **manual gap ability** – a modern twist on the classic random holes[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtung,_die_Kurve!#:~:text=Other%20players%20may%20try%20to,4). Each bike is equipped with a *lightcycle energy cell* that allows for **brief trail deactivation** on command: - The player can tap a “Gap” button to **stop drawing their trail for 0.5 seconds**. After this, the trail resumes as normal. Using it effectively creates a gap/hole in your trail about one bike-length long (given your speed). - This gap can be used defensively (e.g. let an opponent cut you off, but you pass through the gap in your own trail you created earlier) or offensively (bait someone to follow you then cut gap and sharply turn, making them think they can pass but you resume trail to close the gap behind you). - **Resource/Cooldown:** To avoid spamming, the gap ability works off a **cooldown timer** – once used, you must wait e.g. 5 seconds before you can create another gap. Alternatively (or additionally), we can limit uses per round (e.g. each player can only create 2 gaps per round). This ensures timing your gap is a high-skill choice. - **No RNG:** The gaps are fully under player control – no random holes except those players cause. This preserves strategic integrity while still providing the thrill of narrow escapes. - The presence of manual gaps adds depth: players must keep track of opponents’ gap availability and can even “fake” using a gap to trick enemies. It’s a skill differentiator that echoes the old games’ holes but in a fair, controlled way.

**D) Arena & Pressure:** The arena is initially a fixed-size rectangular grid (classic Tron battlefield). To prevent stalemates or excessively long rounds when skilled players remain, we incorporate a **shrinking arena** mechanism as the primary “pressure”: - After a certain time (e.g. 30 seconds into a round), an audio-visual warning triggers: the outer boundary of the arena will start **constricting inward** slowly. This is represented by the grid walls glowing and moving – effectively reducing the play area over time. - The shrink is gradual over, say, 15 seconds, eventually forcing any remaining players into close proximity. Any bike caught outside the new boundary (which could happen if you were riding along the edge and didn’t move inward) will be destroyed (the boundary acts like another deadly wall). - The shrinking mechanism is symmetric and predictable (no randomness in how it shrinks – e.g. it always shrinks uniformly from all sides, maintaining center). This serves to close out rounds decisively, ensuring even a 1v1 duel doesn’t drag on indefinitely with infinite circling. - We can allow the final safe area to still be reasonably sized (not pinch to nothing, just to maybe 20% of original arena) to allow a last skillful duel in a tight space. - **Alternative/Additional hazards:** Optionally, we could introduce other pressure mechanics for variety – e.g. a special “Sudden Death” mode where after X seconds, random sections of the grid floor start to fall away or laser barriers temporarily appear to complicate things. But these would be for custom modes. **Primary design** sticks to the elegant shrinking border as it is fair and requires no new learning curve.

**E) Spawn Fairness:** All spawns are carefully chosen for **symmetry and fairness**: - In a 1v1 duel, bikes spawn at opposite ends of the arena, facing each other or facing a neutral direction (we might have them back-to-back to avoid head-on collision in the first second). Equal distance to the center for both. - In a free-for-all with multiple players, spawns are evenly spaced around the perimeter, with each bike facing toward the arena center. This way every player has roughly equal space at round start and initial moves are fair. No one spawns directly behind another. - Spawn positions can be fixed for a given match (so players learn the layout) but rotated each round to avoid bias (for example, in round 1 Player A is in north position, round 2 they spawn in east position, etc., cycling through). This rotation ensures over a match everyone experiences each starting spot if there’s any minor positional difference. - There will be a **countdown** (e.g. “3-2-1-Go”) at round start during which bikes are ghosted (non-colliding) and trails haven’t started drawing yet, just for 1 second, to allow all players to get oriented and up to speed. After “Go”, collisions and trail-drawing enable. This prevents cheap immediate deaths within the first half-second due to unlucky facing.

**F) Round Structure & Match Format:** - **Casual play:** Players can hop into a lobby and play continuous rounds, with an ongoing scoreboard tracking wins. This is akin to an arcade – possibly with a **win streak** indicator, etc. There’s no hard endpoint unless players leave. - **Competitive/Ranked:** A match consists of a series of rounds. For example, Best-of-9 (first to 5 wins) for duels, or in a 4-player FFA, perhaps play 10 rounds and whoever has the highest total points (e.g. 3 points for 1st place, 2 for 2nd, 1 for 3rd, 0 for 4th each round) wins the match. This reduces the luck of any single round and allows adaptive play. - **Tiebreakers:** If using points and there’s a tie at the end, additional sudden-death rounds are played between the tied players. - **Ranked ruleset:** likely focus on 1v1 and 4-player FFA as separate queues, with ELO or similar rating. Each match outcome yields rating changes. Only default mode (no powerups, manual gaps on, standard speed) is ranked. - **Custom games:** Allow hosts to tweak some parameters (e.g. turn on an item mode, or have larger arenas with more players, etc.) for community fun, but these are unranked.

**G) Accessibility & Controls:** - The game is **playable with just two buttons** (or arrows) – left turn and right turn – just like the classics[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achtung,_die_Kurve!#:~:text=freeware%20%2C%20%2053%20snake,2). This works on keyboard (left/right arrows or A/D) and on controllers (L/R shoulder or stick left/right with snap). - For players who prefer, we support analog stick on a controller for steering: if using that input, in default mode any left deflection beyond a threshold triggers a 90° left turn, right does a right turn. (In analog steering mode/servers, the stick would directly control smooth turn rate.) - On touch devices (if we target mobile browsers or ports), include a simple **on-screen left/right button** or swipe gestures. The Tron: Duel 2 mobile game showed swipe can work[16](https://nobitgames.itch.io/tron-light-cycles-duel-2#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20Tron%20movies,features%20Turn%20AND%20Swipe%20controls), but we’ll also offer a more static UI option (two big buttons) for reliability. - **Visual Accessibility:** We ensure colorblind-friendly trail options (custom colors or patterns) since differentiating trails is key. Also, an option to enlarge the bike models or add an outline for visibility on smaller screens. - **Onboarding:** A quick interactive tutorial will teach basics: turning, how trails work, using the gap ability (so new players know they have that tool), and grinding (we can have a challenge to ride close to a wall). The simplicity of controls means a new player can learn in 30 seconds, but these hints help them appreciate deeper tactics. - **Optional features:** If a player finds 90° turns too rigid, they can play the smooth turn mode in casual rooms. We will also allow “slow mode” servers where game speed is 80% of normal for a more relaxed experience or for accessibility reasons (some might have trouble with high speeds).

This design aims to deliver **pure lightcycle combat** that is easy to pick up (simple controls, clear rules) yet provides layers of mastery through speed management, trail tactics, and timely use of the gap/boost skills. The default experience is true to Tron’s legacy – no random gimmicks, just you, your opponents, and the walls you create – while the modern enhancements (manual gaps, grinding boosts, arena shrink) prevent stalemates and enable thrilling comebacks and highlights. The game will be highly **spectator-friendly** due to the high-contrast neon visuals and the inherent drama of last-second escapes and collisions. Overall, this blueprint combines the **best proven mechanics** from decades of Tron and snake games into one cohesive, competitive package.

## Tech Stack Recommendation

To build and ship this game with smooth online play and broad accessibility, we consider two viable tech stacks. We weigh a **Web-based approach** versus a **traditional game-engine approach**, then choose the best fit:

### Option A: **Web-First Stack (Browser-Based)**

* **Client:** HTML5/JavaScript with **WebGL**. Specifically, use **Three.js** (a popular WebGL framework) to render the 3D lightcycle arena and neon effects. Three.js is lightweight, works across all modern browsers, and can achieve the bright Tron-style visuals (glowing trails, etc.) with shaders. It also allows easy embedding on a webpage for instant play.

* **Networking:** Use **WebSockets** for real-time communication. The server can be a Node.js server using a framework like **Colyseus** or **Socket.io** to manage game state. This will run an authoritative simulation of the game (to prevent cheating) and send state updates to clients. Given the game’s simplicity (essentially moving lines and collision checks), a Node server in JavaScript or TypeScript could handle dozens of matches per instance easily.

* **Physics & Sync:** We can implement the game physics (movement, collisions) in plain JS on both client and server for determinism. Alternatively, use something like **Ammo.js** or **Planck.js** if a physics engine is needed, but likely not – the motion is simple enough to custom-code. The key will be to use a **lockstep or fixed-timestep update** to keep all clients in sync. With WebSockets, we target ~50 ms tick for smooth response. Techniques like client-side prediction and server reconciliation (common in WebSocket games) will keep control feeling responsive.

* **Scalability:** Using a web approach, we can easily scale horizontally – spawn new Node.js processes or use serverless containers for more matches. For large .io modes, Node can handle many concurrent socket connections, and we can partition players by room.

* **Platforms:** The Web build means the game is **playable instantly on any desktop or mobile browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). This greatly aids virality – players can join via a link, no install needed. We can also wrap this in an Electron shell or Cordova to publish on PC or mobile app stores if needed, but the core is browser-based.

* **Dev velocity:** Web tech offers rapid iteration (just refresh the browser). Three.js has a huge community and many examples (even Tron bike demos) to leverage. And no heavy build process or engine licensing – it’s all open.

* **Example precedent:** *Curve Fever Pro* was built in WebGL/HTML5 with authoritative servers, which proved the feasibility for fast-paced multiplayer. Also, **powerline.io** shows even pure Canvas/WebGL can handle real-time snake gameplay with low latency.

### Option B: **Game Engine Stack (Unity or Godot)**

* **Client:** Develop the game in **Unity3D** (C#) or **Godot** (GDscript/C#). Unity has mature tools for 2D/3D rendering, physics, and an ecosystem for multiplatform deployment. We could quickly get neon glow effects via asset store plugins or Unity’s URP (Universal Render Pipeline) with bloom. Godot is an open-source alternative with good 2D performance and growing 3D capability; it might handle this simpler game well too.

* **Networking:** Use a high-level networking solution. In Unity, frameworks like **Mirror** (UNet replacement) or **Photon** could manage the multiplayer. Mirror allows authoritative server builds – we could run Unity headless servers for the game simulation. Photon provides hosted rooms with easier setup but at a cost and less authoritative control (unless using Photon Quantum for determinism). Godot has its own Multiplayer API for WebSocket or ENet.

* **Platforms:** Unity can deploy to basically everything: standalone PC, web (WebGL build), mobile, consoles. The WebGL build would allow browser play, but Unity WebGL builds are heavy (tens of MB) and take time to load, which hurts instant-play appeal. Native apps would run great but require users to install them. Godot can also export to web and native with smaller footprint than Unity, though web exports still have limitations (no threads, etc.).

* **Performance:** Given the simple geometry (bikes and walls), both Unity or Godot could easily handle it at high framerates on modest hardware. Physics in Unity might actually be overkill – we’d likely still code custom collision logic (just grid and line checks) for precision. But using an engine means some overhead and need to workaround engine specifics for a deterministic simulation (especially if we aim for lockstep).

* **Dev velocity:** Unity offers a rich editor, which speeds up designing UI, VFX, etc. On the other hand, implementing advanced netcode might be trickier if not using an off-the-shelf solution. We’d spend time integrating Mirror or writing client prediction code in C#. Godot is lighter but its networking is less documented than Unity’s community solutions.

* **Community support:** Unity has an enormous community and resources for common tasks (like how to do trail renderers, glow, etc., even Tron lightcycle tutorials from hobbyists). Godot’s community is smaller but enthusiastic, and using it would keep the project fully open-source friendly.

### Decision: **Option A – Web-First with Three.js** (Chosen)

We choose **Option A: a Web-first stack using Three.js and a Node.js backend**, for these reasons:

* **Instant Accessibility = Viral Potential:** Our game is multiplayer and inherently more fun with more people; a web build means anyone can join via a URL in seconds. This lowers the barrier to entry dramatically (no install) and facilitates viral sharing (streamers can invite viewers, friends can challenge each other by just clicking a link). This was a key factor in the success of .io games and fits our goal of *“instant play + virality”*.

* **Cross-Platform by default:** The same web client works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and likely on modern mobile browsers. This broad reach is hard to match – Unity’s WebGL could too, but with much larger load and worse mobile compatibility. Three.js will let us optimize specifically for browser performance.

* **Lightweight and Cost-Effective:** A Three.js game can be made very lightweight (maybe a few MB of assets). The backend in Node.js can be hosted on cloud VMs or even serverless. It’s easier to scale horizontally (spin up new Node processes for new game rooms) without needing heavy game server instances. Unity headless servers would consume more memory/CPU per room. Our Node server can also easily integrate with web infrastructure (like our website, databases for accounts, etc.) in one ecosystem.

* **Development agility:** Our team can use web dev workflows – quick testing, using Chrome DevTools for debugging, deploying updates frequently. Continuous deployment is easier when the client is just served from a URL (no app store update delays). We can push balance tweaks or bug fixes to the server and client instantly.

* **Three.js capabilities:** Three.js is more than capable of rendering our neon grid and light trails. We can implement glowing trails using shader effects or post-processing (bloom). We can even import lightcycle models if we have them. Physics-wise, we don’t need a full engine – just do ray-cast or grid collision checks in JS, which is straightforward for axis-aligned 90° movement. The precision needed (no tunneling issues because of the nature of the game) means we won’t suffer from missing a dedicated physics engine.

* **Community and Plugins:** There are existing Three.js examples of Tron cycles and glowing lines – we can learn or borrow techniques. And Node.js has libraries for everything (from colyseus for authoritative rooms to even predetermined seeding for deterministic simulations if we go that route).

* **Engine Overhead vs Simplicity:** Using Unity would give us a lot, but much of it we don’t need (physics, 3D environment complexity). Our game logic is simple enough that writing it in JS/TS from scratch is feasible and might actually result in a cleaner, more deterministic outcome (no fighting engine quirks). We also avoid the heavy initial download of a Unity WebGL build or the friction of requiring a standalone app. Every extra step to play could lose potential users.

* **Update: WebAssembly for performance:** If needed, we can even optimize critical parts (like collision checking loops) by using WebAssembly or transferring some logic to a compiled language and interfacing – but likely unnecessary given JS can easily handle a few bikes and walls.

**Conclusion:** The Web-first stack aligns with our goals of broad accessibility and fast-paced adoption. We’ll develop the game with Three.js + Node.js, ensuring it runs smoothly in a browser with full WebGL graphics. This choice lets us launch the game on the web (on our site or gaming portals) and reach a huge audience quickly. From there, if desired, we can still port to native (packaging the web app into an Electron app for PC or a WebView-based mobile app) with minimal effort. But the core experience will be **browser-based, multiplayer, and easy to jump into**, which we believe is key for a multiplayer arcade game in 2026.
